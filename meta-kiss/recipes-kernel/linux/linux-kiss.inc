# As we are using a fully mainline kernel there is no need to clone an
# entire git repository, which would take time and disk space. Downloading
# a tarball is enough. In real cases you might have an internal kernel
# repository with your branches, so it can make sense to fetch from
# there. Or you could be using a mainline kernel with only a few patches on
# top, and in that case downloading a tarball and applying your patches can
# be a good solution.
